There was I on the rusty deck of the Maria Bella heading off home. Depressing. The summer was over. Europe was saying an indifferent goodbye. I spat into the ocean and turned my back on Europe.
Africa was waiting on the other side of the strait, just hazy green hills from here. Yet it was a continent, with jungles, deserts, exotic cities, elephants, cannibals …
I was saying good-bye to Africa too — without ever even seeing it. Andy Davis: ex-student, ex-painter. Back to the country which would grab me the second my foot touched the shore. The Army. The job. Responsibilities. I could see it all and I was deeply depressed.
A group of bagged men appeared on the deck. A new passenger? I moved over for a better view. My only fellow passenger was an old French priest with red eyes and not a word of English. Captain Sebastiano spoke a kind of English, but we didn’t understand each other well. So another passenger would really help since I didn’t want to talk to myself.
It was another passenger, but I was still out of luck. An Arab woman head to toes in black clothes and a veil. She would talk Arabic or maybe French and be a hundred years old. I wished I had bought some more books for the trip.
When she passed she raised her head, and I stared into the darkest, blackest, loveliest eyes I had ever seen. From the way she moved I could tell she was young.
I went to my cabin and dug out a bottle of grappa. One look, and I knew. Maybe when I saw what was behind the veil, I would change my mind. Probably. But my imagination worked up. Ten days of, the sea, just her and me.
The gong has gone, telling that the meal was ready. I hurried to wash and remembering our new passenger put on my last clean shirt and my tie for the occasion.
I was finishing my soup when she came into the dining room.
She was seated at an empty place at the long table. She was silent, calm, and those eyes above the veil, just as I remembered them, only maybe better.
“Buona sera”, I said, «Е signora… signorina…”
“I speek English eef you weesh”.
“I do too”. Witty as hell tonight.
She just nodded at that. My brain stopped working and there was nothing I could say. I watched out of the corner of my eye as the soup arrived and was put in front of her. Now something had to be done with the veil.
It was simple enough. She just unhooked it and took it off.
This was a face in a thousand, the kind they photograph for the magazine covers. Smooth and flawless. Full lips, red and moist, a graceful nose. If I wasn’t such a second-rate artist I would have painted that face. I wanted to kiss those lips.
“My name is Andy Davis. Your fellow passenger”.
She looked at me again, frowning slightly. Translation problems? Should I tell her again? Before I could make my mind up, she spoke.
“I am fellow passenger as well. My name ees Tamu Safari”.
“That’s a very nice name”.
“My father gave eet to me”
“That’s great. My father gave me mine too”. He hadn’t. In fact I was named after my mother’s uncle.
The thing was she wanted to talk, I felt that at once. And her accent wasn’t as bad as I thought it was. We talked through the rest of the meal, and she told me about this town where she came from, I forget its name, and how her old man was in business, and how she was on the way to the States to stay with relatives. I told her how I got out of college and had worked at a job and saved to come to Europe, and how my old man was a president of a large corporation, most of which was true, except I forgot to mention I got out of college by being thrown out, and how the Army had its jaws open to swallow me as soon as I appeared again. And how I didn’t want to get swallowed.
The next morning when I came up, she was sitting in a deckchair reading the Bible. She was no longer wearing the veil, but was still dressed in black.
“Do you know this book?” she asked.
“Yeah, sure. Always a copy around the house. A best-seller”.
The priest gave it to me at breakfast. He said it would do me good. Parts of it are exactly like the Koran.»
I dropped into the next chair and opened my shirt. The sun was warm, and I was not getting into any religious discussions, thank you, no.
“Great day for sunbathing”. Her eyebrows lifted daintily.
“Sunbathing. That’s what we do a lot. In your country you wear many heavy clothes to keep off the heat of the sun, but we do it the other way. We wear heavy clothes all winter, then peel down in the summer to get a tan. Everybody does it”.
“Peel? That means to strip off the skin”. I had to laugh, and she hesitated a second, then laughed too. “I have made a foolish linguistic mistake?”
“No. You’re correct. Peel, that’s slang. Like, look. I’ll peel off my shirt now so that the sun can get to me”. And I did.
“Do you peel all your clothes? We would never do this”.
“No, not all the clothes. We usually wear swim clothes for sun-bathing”.
“And what are they?”
“It’s well, hard to describe. Please wait a second. I have a magazine in my cabin with pictures in it, that’ll give you an idea”. And I brought her an old copy of Life.
“I see”, Tamu said, but never changed expression. Very cool, this girl.
“May I read the rest of the magazine?”
“Great, keep it, if you want. I’m going to get some coffee — want some?”
She shook her head no, and I went after the coffee, which I needed. When I came back she was there in the same deck chair. Only this time wearing a black low-cut swim suit.
“Is there something wrong with it?” she asked.
“No, great, couldn’t be greater”.
“If I am to go to the States, I must dress as other people dress. Now we’ll sunbathe, and I hope you’ll tell me more about your country”. I did. She was eager to hear everything about our great land and I gave it to her. She listened attentively to every word.
Time slipped by very fast. There was a gong in my ear. It was time to get dressed for dinner.
When I passed the captain’s cabin, the door opened suddenly.
“I am watching you with this woman”, hissed Captain Sebastiano.
“Don’t be jealous, not your type”.
“Don’t make fun with me. She is no good Arab woman with her clothes off and no veil. And the talk. At first she speaks English very badly, then all at once she speaks it perfectly”.
“Can’t hate the girl because she has got a good ear”.
“She’s a spy! That’s what she is”.
“You have too much imagination, Captain, just too much”.
But did he? Yes, Tamu was speaking English incredibly better than just a day earlier. She was a bright girl, that’s all. She picked things up fast. Nothing else.
After dinner Tamu dived into reading. I found a magazine with a crossword puzzle I had not done. Tamu showed no interest in continuing our conversation.
“Fraggis… frittle…” I muttered.
“What is that?” she asked.
“Microscopic substructure”, I answered. “Eight letters beginning with FR”.
“Frustule, botany, the siliceous cell wall of a diatom”. Then she was back at her reading.
It fit. It was right. Just like a definition out of a dictionary. Is that why her English was so good? Had she memorized a dictionary?
“Yes, that seems to fit,» I said. «Here, nineteen down, beginning with an H, six letters, a feudal tribute —“
“Heriot”.
And she did it, I swear, while she was reading. I was beginning to sweat. I had never even heard of heriot, but it fit perfectly.
“Here is an interesting puzzle, ha-ha. There are 92 hunters and each of them shoots 430 ducks. How many ducks do they kill?”
“39,560”. Turning the page, not even looking up.
This was all wrong. She could do in her head what I had to work out on paper. I’m not sure I liked it.
“I’ll be back in a minute”, I muttered and got out.
“A bottle of grappa, please”. I said to the barman.
He dug out a bottle of grappa and dusted it off.
“Six hundred lire or one American dollar”.
I slapped at my pocket and realized I had left my wallet in my cabin.
“I’ll be right back”. I said and ran down to my cabin.
The door of my cabin was slightly open, though I had left it closed. And locked.
Tamu was standing over my open suitcase with my passport in her hand.
What did you say in a situation like that?
“You have broken into my cabin and are stealing my passport!”
“How cruel of you. The door was open and I came in. I’ve stolen nothing”.
“You have it in your hand!”
“I am examining it. It is a very interesting document”.
“Now hand it back”.
She hesitated a moment, looking at me closely, before she spoke.
“I’d like to examine it further. Just for a little while. You know I’ll give it back — what else could I do?”
What else? What did she mean? I was still angry.
“Of course you can examine it. But the examination fee for the standard blue American passport is a hundred dollars an hour”.
“Very well. Here is the hundred dollars”.
And she had it too, in a little purse she dug out of her clothes. They were in my palm and she was out of the door before I could realize what had happened.
One hundred dollars. They smelt like the real green. And a minute later the barman gave me the change from two bottles of real Scotch. It tasted very; very good indeed.
Europe was behind me, America ahead, a mystery woman in my life, and money in my pocket. I sat in the deck chair and drank and looked at the stars which were doing things that I had never seen stars do before, and it was just pure luck I didn’t fall into the ocean.
I found myself in her cabin. It was dark.
“My passport. You have rented my passport and the hour is up”.
“Your passport is back in your room. I returned it some time ago”.
“Passport”, I said, putting my hands out to keep my balance. My hands were on her shoulders.
“Tamu…”
“You’d better go to your cabin now, Andy. We’ll talk in the morning”.
“Tamu”, I pulled her closer.
Her skin was velvet.
It was afternoon before I could crawl out of bed, and crawl was all I could do. I was in my own cabin, and I never questioned how I had got there. I shaved, chewed all the aspirins I had, took a cold shower, and rang for the messboy, who brought me lots of black coffee.
This was going to be a good trip after all. I went out and down the corridor, whistling, to Tamu’s cabin and pushed the door open.
“Hi!” I said warmly, but there was no one there. The cabin was neat, there were no personal things in sight at all. Except for an American passport on the table. Mine? But mine was in my cabin.
It couldn’t be true but it was. Tamu stared up at me out of the picture. The page opposite gave the name of Tammy Savani. Tamu Safari? Birthplace, Connecticut, USA. Was she a spy then and the captain was right? And what had she wanted my passport for?
“When you are through examining it, may I have it back?” she asked. Inside with her back to the closed door.
“You’re an American?”
“No”.
“A spy then?”
“No. I am a commercial representative representing certain financial interests”.
“You said you were a simple Arab girl”.
“A necessary cover”, she said calmly.
“What country are you from?”
“None you know”.
“My geography isn’t that bad, maybe my best subject. I know every country, even the new ones.»
“My country is incredibly distant, a matter of light-years”.
“Yeah, yeah, like on another planet”.
“That’s correct”.
Well, that stopped me, as you might imagine.
“I am here to try to open commercial relationships with your world. I am looking for a cultural contact for our organization”.
“You talk like a lawyer, Tamu”.
“I am one, among other things”.
“And one of these things is a woman. Do you want to tell me about that? Is it an accident that your people and mine are so much alike?”
“We are not alike. We have many similar features, but the differences, I am afraid, are much greater”.
“You look pretty similar to me”.
“Plastic surgery. Our medical techniques are far beyond yours in every way”.
I tried to imagine what she really looked like — then tried not to imagine. Especially after last night!
“I’m — I am very sorry about what happened here last night. I’m afraid I wasn’t quite myself…”
“I knew it. The smell of alcohol was very strong. I thought you might make a lot of noise if you did not get your way. I couldn’t turn on the lights because my copier was preparing my passport from yours. So what I did was the wisest thing to do”.
“Yes, ha-ha, wisest. Glad you didn’t mind”.
“And I’d like to tell you one more thing. Before going to your planet I adopted this form of the female of your species”.
“Then you are…”
“Male. Exactly. One of the executives in our large corporation”.
There was I on the rusty deck of the Maria Bella heading off home. Depressing. The summer was over. Europe was saying an indifferent goodbye. I spat into the ocean and turned my back on Europe.
Africa was waiting on the other side of the strait, just hazy green hills from here. Yet it was a continent, with jungles, deserts, exotic cities, elephants, cannibals …

“I am watching you with this woman”, hissed Captain Sebastiano.
“Don’t be jealous, not your type”.
“Don’t make fun with me. She is no good Arab woman with her clothes off and no veil. And the talk. At first she speaks English very badly, then all at once she speaks it perfectly”.
“Can’t hate the girl because she has got a good ear”.
“She’s a spy! That’s what she is”.
“You have too much imagination, Captain, just too much”.
But did he? Yes, Tamu was speaking English incredibly better than just a day earlier. She was a bright girl, that’s all. She picked things up fast. Nothing else.
After dinner Tamu dived into reading. I found a magazine with a crossword puzzle I had not done. Tamu showed no interest in continuing our conversation.
“Fraggis… frittle…” I muttered.
“What is that?” she asked.
“Microscopic substructure”, I answered. “Eight letters beginning with FR”.
“Frustule, botany, the siliceous cell wall of a diatom”. Then she was back at her reading.
It fit. It was right. Just like a definition out of a dictionary. Is that why her English was so good? Had she memorized a dictionary?
“Yes, that seems to fit,» I said. «Here, nineteen down, beginning with an H, six letters, a feudal tribute —“
“Heriot”.
And she did it, I swear, while she was reading. I was beginning to sweat. I had never even heard of heriot, but it fit perfectly.
“Here is an interesting puzzle, ha-ha. There are 92 hunters and each of them shoots 430 ducks. How many ducks do they kill?”
“39,560”. Turning the page, not even looking up.
This was all wrong. She could do in her head what I had to work out on paper. I’m not sure I liked it.
“I’ll be back in a minute”, I muttered and got out.
“A bottle of grappa, please”. I said to the barman.
He dug out a bottle of grappa and dusted it off.
“Six hundred lire or one American dollar”.
I slapped at my pocket and realized I had left my wallet in my cabin.
“I’ll be right back”. I said and ran down to my cabin.
The door of my cabin was slightly open, though I had left it closed. And locked.
Tamu was standing over my open suitcase with my passport in her hand.
What did you say in a situation like that?
“You have broken into my cabin and are stealing my passport!”
“How cruel of you. The door was open and I came in. I’ve stolen nothing”.
“You have it in your hand!”
“I am examining it. It is a very interesting document”.
“Now hand it back”.
She hesitated a moment, looking at me closely, before she spoke.
“I’d like to examine it further. Just for a little while. You know I’ll give it back — what else could I do?”
What else? What did she mean? I was still angry.
“Of course you can examine it. But the examination fee for the standard blue American passport is a hundred dollars an hour”.
“Very well. Here is the hundred dollars”.
And she had it too, in a little purse she dug out of her clothes. They were in my palm and she was out of the door before I could realize what had happened.
One hundred dollars. They smelt like the real green. And a minute later the barman gave me the change from two bottles of real Scotch. It tasted very; very good indeed.
Europe was behind me, America ahead, a mystery woman in my life, and money in my pocket. I sat in the deck chair and drank and looked at the stars which were doing things that I had never seen stars do before, and it was just pure luck I didn’t fall into the ocean.
I found myself in her cabin. It was dark.
“My passport. You have rented my passport and the hour is up”.
“Your passport is back in your room. I returned it some time ago”.
“Passport”, I said, putting my hands out to keep my balance. My hands were on her shoulders.
“Tamu…”
“You’d better go to your cabin now, Andy. We’ll talk in the morning”.
“Tamu”, I pulled her closer.
Her skin was velvet.
It was afternoon before I could crawl out of bed, and crawl was all I could do. I was in my own cabin, and I never questioned how I had got there. I shaved, chewed all the aspirins I had, took a cold shower, and rang for the messboy, who brought me lots of black coffee.
This was going to be a good trip after all. I went out and down the corridor, whistling, to Tamu’s cabin and pushed the door open.
“Hi!” I said warmly, but there was no one there. The cabin was neat, there were no personal things in sight at all. Except for an American passport on the table. Mine? But mine was in my cabin.
It couldn’t be true but it was. Tamu stared up at me out of the picture. The page opposite gave the name of Tammy Savani. Tamu Safari? Birthplace, Connecticut, USA. Was she a spy then and the captain was right? And what had she wanted my passport for?
“When you are through examining it, may I have it back?” she asked. Inside with her back to the closed door.
“You’re an American?”
“No”.
“A spy then?”
“No. I am a commercial representative representing certain financial interests”.
“You said you were a simple Arab girl”.
“A necessary cover”, she said calmly.
“What country are you from?”
“None you know”.
“My geography isn’t that bad, maybe my best subject. I know every country, even the new ones.»
“My country is incredibly distant, a matter of light-years”.
“Yeah, yeah, like on another planet”.
“That’s correct”.
Well, that stopped me, as you might imagine.
“I am here to try to open commercial relationships with your world. I am looking for a cultural contact for our organization”.
“You talk like a lawyer, Tamu”.
“I am one, among other things”.
“And one of these things is a woman. Do you want to tell me about that? Is it an accident that your people and mine are so much alike?”
“We are not alike. We have many similar features, but the differences, I am afraid, are much greater”.
“You look pretty similar to me”.
“Plastic surgery. Our medical techniques are far beyond yours in every way”.
I tried to imagine what she really looked like — then tried not to imagine. Especially after last night!
“I’m — I am very sorry about what happened here last night. I’m afraid I wasn’t quite myself…”
“I knew it. The smell of alcohol was very strong. I thought you might make a lot of noise if you did not get your way. I couldn’t turn on the lights because my copier was preparing my passport from yours. So what I did was the wisest thing to do”.
“Yes, ha-ha, wisest. Glad you didn’t mind”.
“And I’d like to tell you one more thing. Before going to your planet I adopted this form of the female of your species”.
“Then you are…”
“Male. Exactly. One of the executives in our large corporation”.
